# ECS171 Group 19 Final Project Repository

## Repo Rules

1. Unless we've all agreed, **never edit the master branch**. Make your own branch, push it upstream, and push to that. I recommend setting up your own branch as soon as you clone the repo so you don't forget and need to fix things later.
1. Have a .gitignore file! You don't want to clutter the repo even on your own branch in case merges need to happen.
